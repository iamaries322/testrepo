download pbi-tools zip folder
move to C:/tool/pbi-tools (for easier path)

create folder on desktop(report) 
open in vscode and put the following commands in the terminal:
git init (make it git enabled)
git lfs install (working with large data) 
note: git lfs install is applied on only "reports" folder, any new folders you make needs "git lfs install" t be used

git lfs track "*.pbix"    (include the quotations"
this tracks all the pbix files in our git enabled folder
   
create file withing "report" folder named as ".pbixproj.json"
go to this link : "https://github.com/iamaries322/testrepo"
search for ".pbisproj.json" on this link and copy its contents to your folder"

create folder ".github" > create sub-folder "workflows" > create a file "deploy-reports.yml"

put your test powerbi dashboard in "report" (i.e. git enabled) folder
keep your power bi dashboard opened and then 

on vscode terminal enter following commands without quotes
"pbi-tools info"

scroll down and you would find "Process ID" 
this is would help you link your currently open dashboard to pbi-tools

now put the command:
"pbi-tools extract -pid "processID" -watch"
here copy the process id you got from the pbi-tools info

now any changes made to pbix file will be reflected in the "config.json" file in source control section of vscode
