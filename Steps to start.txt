Quick setup guide on website :
https://pbi.tools/tutorials/getting-started-cli.html

download pbi-tools zip folder
move to C:/tool/pbi-tools (for easier path)
start menu - env - edit 

create folder on desktop(report) 
open in vscode and put the following commands in the terminal:
git init (make it git enabled)
git lfs install (working with large data) 
note: git lfs install is applied on only "reports" folder, any new folders you make needs "git lfs install" t be used

git lfs track "*.pbix"    (include the quotations"
this tracks all the pbix files in our git enabled folder
   
create file withing "report" folder named as ".pbixproj.json"
go to this link : "https://github.com/iamaries322/testrepo"
search for ".pbisproj.json" on this link and copy its contents to your folder"

create folder ".github" > create sub-folder "workflows" > create a file "deploy-reports.yml"

put your test powerbi dashboard in "report" (i.e. git enabled) folder
keep your power bi dashboard opened and then 

on vscode terminal enter following commands without quotes
"pbi-tools info"

scroll down and you would find "Process ID" 
this is would help you link your currently open dashboard to pbi-tools

now put the command:
"pbi-tools extract -pid "processID" -watch"
here copy the process id you got from the pbi-tools info1

now any changes made to pbix file will be reflected in the "config.json" file in source control section of vscode


go to your pbi dash and save it then commit from to github.

Before commiting, set global username & email
git config --global user.name "your name" 
git config --global user.email "your email" 



add a new pbi report
run command 
pbi-tools info (for processID)
pbi-tools extract -pid "processID" -watch
